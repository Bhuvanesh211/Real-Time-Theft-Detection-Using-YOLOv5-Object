â€”Deep learning is a machine learning approach 
that trains computers to accomplish things that humans do 
instinctively. It teaches the compute/AI to visualize the world as 
humans see it and visualize it. This is done possible by 
mimicking the human brain along with its complex network of 
neurons. The concept of neural network is widely considered in 
such cases where the AI designs its own brain/neural network 
by taking in examples. While approximate predictions can be 
done with a single layer neural network, additional hidden 
layers can lead for higher accuracies and also better 
optimization. Object detection is a subset of deep learning, 
which involves the detection of objects within frames. Using the 
above technologies, the concept of the theft detection can be met. 
Theft of valuable objects is increasing day by day and is an 
extremely important problem with respect to the global scale 
and due to the fact that there are only manual systems present 
to detect theft, many of the thieves/robbers never get caught and 
repeat their crimes. Thus, the need for an automated system 
which detects theft with good accuracy and immediately alerts 
the owners must be developed.  You Only Look Once (YOLO) 
v5 model, an object detection model that is best suited for our 
case regarding theft detection is considered here. The YOLO v5 
object detection model is then trained using our own dataset. 
After its training its accuracies and prediction of both objects 
and theft is done in real time along with an alert being issued to 
concerned authorities and the owner of those objects/items.
